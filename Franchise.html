      <p>Technology is growing at an exponential 
        rate all over the world. We are experiencing 
        a paradigm shift in the global market of the 
        21st century where large-scale industries are 
        re-modelling their business based on technology. 
        These actions of strategic change within multi-national corporations fundamentally indicate that 
        the growth of the future exists within technology 
        and it’s operational markets.</p>

      <div class="box1">
        <p>Observing this trend a question arises, 
          if large-scale corporations can prosper 
          in these trillion dollar industries, then 
          what about the smaller firms and individual 
          business owners?</p>

        <div class="box2">
          <p>How can the smaller competitors thrive 
            in such markets against giant corporations?
            To tackle such a dilemma and bring a balanced 
            solution, we need a platform where smaller 
            businesses and individuals could be unified 
            and compete against multi-national corporations 
            for their share of the market.</p>

        <p>Any business model falls apart against the test of 
          time when it fails to generate compound annual 
          growth where incremental revenue on a yearly basis is 
          the fundamental backbone of the given business economy.
          <br><br>
          However we cannot neglect the limitations and economic challenges 
          faced by the potential franchisee, hence, in order to ensure a mutual 
          balance, we have structured the investment breakdown with high variability 
          based on our client on-boarding capacity, where the minimally recommended 
          investment opportunity begins 12 lakh onwards and peaks at 25 lakh throughout 
          a 10 year contractual period of business.
          <br><br>
          When you invest in a franchise, you have every expectation and right to 
          know what your money is paying for. A big part of the answer lies in the initial 
          ‘franchise package’. 
          There is no ‘one size fits all’ and keeping that in mind we have further organized the
          packages based on experience, cost and fundamental necessities.</p>
